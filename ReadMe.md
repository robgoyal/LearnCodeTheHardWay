# Learn Code the Hard Way

#### Purpose

This repository contains exercises that I am completing while going through the tutorials in [Learn Code The Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/). I will complete the exercises for Python and C as well as the extra credit assignments. 


#### Motivation 

Attempting to learn Python and C to become more experienced with embedded systems. 

##### Code Structure

The Python code is written in Python 2.7. 

The exercise subdirectories are organized as follows:
* Each exercise is within a directory
* The tutorial that I followed is listed as ex1.py (directory ex1 is used as an example)
* The other files contained within the directory were exercises that I completed such ex1_firstex.py and ex1_secondex.py
