### Exercise 27

An exercise on memorizing logic and Boolean characters. 

The following characters are Boolean characters: 

Symbol | Explanation 
|---|---|
and | compares two vvalues to see if they are the same
or | compares two values to see if either is True 
not | Negates the value 
!= | Compares two values to see if they are not equal to each other
== | Compares two values to to see if they are equal in value to each other
>= | Greater than or equal to comparator
<= | Less than or equal to Comparator
True | Boolean character of value True
False | Boolean character of value False

<br />

The following are truth tables: 
<br />

NOT | EVAL
--- | ---
not False | True
not True | False

<br /> 

OR | EVAL
--- | --- 
True or False | True
True or True | True
False or True | True
False or False | False

<br />

AND | EVAL
--- | ---
True and False | False
True and True | True
False and True | False
False and False | False

<br / >

NOT OR | EVAL
--- | ---
not(True or False) | False
not(True or True) | False
not(False or True) | False
not(False or False) | True

<br/>

NOT AND | EVAL
--- | --- 
not(True and False) | True
not(True and True) | False
not(False and True) | True
not(False and False) | True

<br / > 

!= | EVAL
--- | --- 
1 != 0 | True
1 != 1 | False
0 != 1 | True
0 != 0 | False

<br / > 

== | EVAL 
--- | --- 
1 == 0 | False
1 == 1 | True 
0 == 1 | False
0 == 0 | True
