### Read Some Code

The purpose of this exercise is to go out and read some code on my own and try to dissect what is going on. I used the daily_checks.py file in the geekcomputers repo on Github. 

I will just write down on which lines what is happening.

\* I'll probably update this more as I learn more and improve my understanding of what's happening*

- Lines 20: Imported the strftime function from the time module
- Lines 22 - 26: A function which clears the screen if its a posix system or a windows system
- Lines 28 - 31: A function to print the daily check sheets and then opens Word, opens the file, prints the file content and closes Word
